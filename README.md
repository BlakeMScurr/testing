hello_world.go:

When you run `go run hello_world.go` you should have the output "hello world 1 2 3"

recursion.go:

When you run `go run recursion.go n` you should get the nth fibonnaci number.
For example, `go run recursion.go 10` should give 55
Also, `go run recursion.go 0` should give 0
Once that's working, try altering the algorithm so it can quickly find numbers above 50.
(The new algorithm doesn't have to be recursive).
